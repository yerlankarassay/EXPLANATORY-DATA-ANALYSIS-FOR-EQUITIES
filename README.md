# Quantitative Financial Analysis & EDA Engine | Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, yfinance

Developed a robust, object-oriented engine in Python for end-to-end analysis of financial time-series data, from programmatic acquisition via API to insight generation.

Engineered a data pipeline for wrangling and cleaning diverse asset data (equities, ETFs), handling missing values (NaNs), and calculating key financial metrics including simple/logarithmic returns and annualized rolling volatility.

Implemented a suite of EDA visualizations to derive actionable insights, including normalized performance charts, return distribution analysis (histograms, Q-Q plots), and correlation heatmaps.

Analyzed asset return distributions against theoretical models, identifying "fat-tail" risk characteristics with Q-Q plots, and quantified inter-asset relationships to inform portfolio diversification strategies
